Here's a link to the Vis! https://www.informationisbeautifulawards.com/showcase/204-nobels-no-degrees

This week I chose a gorgeous reflection that was created in 2013 that shows that explores and analyzes the winners of Nobel Prizes from 1901-2012. The longer
I look at this visualization the more impressive it gets. The way the vis uses color is simple, organized, and consistent, making it easy to follow which Nobel
Prize category you're looking at. The dots are colored to their specific category, and the lines coming from the universities are color coated by catergory and 
mapped by size (thickness) depending upon how many people from their university won a prize. The color is also used in text to clearly show which prize is being
discussed, incorporated in the blocks showing hometown cities, and expressed as a solid line showing the average age for that specific category. The colored size mapping 
is also helpful to see which universtity has produced the most winners (Harvard) without even needing to see a written number. 

Another special component to this vis is how it distinguishes female winners from the male winners, and has footnotes to further describe special cases, which is awesome!
The last thing I wanted to note is how the vis does a great job being coherent and intrgrating many aspects of the people who won the prize such as grade level and 
hometown. 

While I really loved this vis, I did notice a type in the intro paragraph, but I believe this award-centered visualization won an award, so it's ok! If I were to comment
on one thing that was not ideal about this vis is the inconsistency considering grade level. I noticed that multiple categories have some winners that don't have a degree,
however the in-depth examination 5 says that there was only one self-taught winner. Although it is likely I am interpreting the data incorrectly!
